# Vehicle Insurance Interest Prediction

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to help an insurance company predict whether existing health insurance policyholders will be interested in purchasing vehicle insurance from the company.
We will build a machine learning model using historical data that includes customer demographics, vehicle information, and policy details to make predictions.
