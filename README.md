# Vehicle Insurance Interest Prediction


## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to help an insurance company predict whether existing health insurance policyholders will be interested in purchasing vehicle insurance from the company.
We will build a machine learning model using historical data that includes customer demographics, vehicle information, and policy details to make predictions.

## Problem Statement

Our client, an insurance company, currently provides health insurance to its customers.
The company seeks to extend its offerings by providing vehicle insurance to these same customers. 
The challenge is to predict whether a customer, who already has health insurance, will be interested in purchasing vehicle insurance.

## Key Objectives:

1. Build a predictive model that classifies whether a policyholder is interested in vehicle insurance.
2. Utilize demographic information, vehicle details, and policy features to make accurate predictions.
3. Optimize the model to maximize accuracy and other performance metrics.
